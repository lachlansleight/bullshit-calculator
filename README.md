# Bullshit Calculator

A super-simple web tool to display the results of simulated replacement probability experiments.

I wrote something similar in Processing many years ago. I think I originally wrote it back when I was super into the old-school pokemon games, and I wanted to know just how bullshit it was that I hadn't caught that charmander with a 15% catch-rate after a few dozen attempts. Similar questions keep cropping up, so I kept finding myself opening up my old crappy Processing sketch.

So I decided to make it a web-app. This took like 45 minutes to put together at 2am, so don't judge me if it's broken or something. :D
